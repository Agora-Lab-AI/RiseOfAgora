### Description: What is it?
Solarpunk Athens is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game set in a solarpunk-themed Athens. The game integrates advanced conversational AI (ConvAI) for NPC interactions and offers a unique blend of in-game and real-world skill development. Players defend the Agora servers from rogue AI hoards while also enhancing their skills both within and outside the game environment.

### Problem: What problem is this solving?
The gaming industry often lacks titles that bridge the gap between virtual skill acquisition and real-world application. Players spend countless hours in games without tangible real-world benefits. Solarpunk Athens aims to merge the gaming experience with genuine skill development, fostering a community of learners and contributors.

### Why: How do we know this is a real problem and worth solving?
The rise of educational platforms and the gamification of learning indicate a demand for engaging ways to acquire new skills. By integrating real-world skill tracking and development into a gaming environment, we cater to both gamers and lifelong learners.

### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?
Success can be measured by:
- Player engagement and retention rates.
- The number of players actively participating in group tasks and contributing to Agora.
- Feedback from players on the effectiveness of skill development both in-game and in the real world.
- Growth in the community and collaborations on platforms like GitHub.

### Audience: Who are we building for?
- Gamers interested in MMOs with a unique twist.
- Individuals looking to develop real-world skills in a gamified environment.
- Members of the Agora community and open-source contributors.
- Fans of solarpunk aesthetics and narratives.

### What: Roughly, what does this look like in the product?
The game presents a solarpunk Athens where players interact with ConvAI-driven NPCs. Players have in-game skills to develop, such as combat or diplomacy, and real-world skills like hacking.
